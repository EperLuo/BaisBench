  "hypothesis": "In my research, I focused on understanding the unique characteristics of human palmoplantar skin compared to non-palmoplantar skin, particularly the hip region. Palmoplantar skin plays a crucial role in providing mechanical resistance due to its specialized structure. However, the cellular and transcriptional programs that differentiate this skin type from others are not well understood. I utilized both bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) from skin biopsies, which allowed me to explore the distinct cellular and molecular environments in different skin sites. The sequencing dataset included samples from 15 healthy individuals, with a total of 30 biopsies from palm, sole, and hip.",
