  "hypothesis": "In this research, I aimed to explore how mutations in clonal hematopoiesis (CH), specifically in TET2 and DNMT3A, affect peripheral blood cells and contribute to inflammation. These mutations are linked to an increased risk of hematologic malignancy and cardiovascular disease. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) combined with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) barcoding, I profiled gene expression and mutation status in 66,968 peripheral blood cells from 17 patients with CH and 7 controls. This multiomic approach allowed for a direct comparison of mutant and non-mutant cells, revealing how genetic mutations shape cellular phenotypes and inflammatory pathways.",
