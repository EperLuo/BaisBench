  "hypothesis": "In this study, we aimed to characterize the cellular composition of the mouse and human prostate, with a focus on urethral luminal epithelial cells and their role in castration resistance and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Previous research has identified facultative prostate progenitors in the proximal prostate, but their precise anatomical and molecular identity remains unclear. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on mouse prostate and urethral epithelial cells, as well as human prostate cells, we identified the urethral luminal epithelial population as a distinct and castration-insensitive cell type. The sequencing dataset includes four mouse prostates and three mouse urethra samples, along with deeper sequencing of three previously analyzed human prostate specimens.",
