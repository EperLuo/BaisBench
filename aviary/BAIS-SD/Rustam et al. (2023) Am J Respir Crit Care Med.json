  "hypothesis": "In my research, I focused on understanding the unique cellular organization of human distal airways and how this organization is altered in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). I utilized a novel dissection method to obtain single-cell transcriptomic data from distal airways, allowing me to analyze the cellular composition in detail. The dataset comprised a total of 111,412 single cells isolated from different airway regions of 12 healthy lung donors and pre-terminal bronchioles from 5 patients with COPD. This analysis aimed to identify the biological changes occurring in the distal airways in COPD at single-cell resolution.",
