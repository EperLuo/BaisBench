  "hypothesis": "In this study, I focused on exploring the pancreatic islet environment in individuals with Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), autoantibody-positive individuals (AAb+), and control subjects without T1D. The goal was to identify novel cellular states and molecular perturbations linked to T1D pathogenesis by leveraging single-cell multi-omics technologies. I performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on over 80,000 cells from pancreatic islets, combining it with mass cytometry (CyTOF) and imaging mass cytometry (IMC) to map the gene expression, protein markers, and spatial distributions of the cells. This comprehensive dataset allowed for detailed insights into the cellular and molecular dynamics in T1D.",
