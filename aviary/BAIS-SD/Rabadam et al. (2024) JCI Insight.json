  "hypothesis": "In my research, I aimed to understand the immune dysregulation in juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) using single-cell transcriptomics. This autoimmune disorder is characterized by a type I interferon response and specific autoantibodies, but the mechanisms behind its pathogenesis remain unclear. By analyzing the peripheral blood of patients at different disease stages, the data revealed critical insights into the cellular interactions that contribute to JDM. The sequencing data encompassed single-cell RNA sequencing combined with surface protein expression profiling from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 15 JDM patients, totaling 22 samples, alongside data from 5 healthy controls.",
