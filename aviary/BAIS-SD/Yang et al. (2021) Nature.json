  "hypothesis": "In this research, I aimed to explore the neurological effects of severe COVID-19 by examining changes in brain and choroid plexus cell types. Given the reported neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients, it was crucial to understand the cellular and molecular alterations occurring in the brain following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We utilized single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to analyze a large dataset consisting of 65,309 single-nucleus transcriptomes from post-mortem brain samples taken from both control individuals and patients who had died from COVID-19.",
