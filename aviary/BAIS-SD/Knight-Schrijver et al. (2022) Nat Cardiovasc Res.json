  "hypothesis": "In this study, we aimed to compare the cellular composition and transcriptional programs of adult and fetal human tissues using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). The development and differentiation of cell types in fetal tissues play a crucial role in understanding how adult organs maintain homeostasis and respond to disease. By analyzing both adult and fetal cells at single-cell resolution, we can identify key developmental trajectories and molecular differences that distinguish these stages. The dataset consists of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from adult and fetal human tissues, covering major organ systems. A total of 80000 cells were sequenced, allowing for detailed comparisons of gene expression profiles, lineage hierarchies, and functional characteristics between fetal and adult cells.",
