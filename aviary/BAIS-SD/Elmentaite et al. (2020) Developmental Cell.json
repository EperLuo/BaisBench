  "hypothesis": "In this study, I aimed to map the development of the human intestine, focusing on its early fetal stages, by using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Understanding human intestinal development is crucial as abnormalities in this process are linked to diseases like Crohn\u2019s disease (CD). My work involved analyzing samples from human embryos (6-10 weeks post-conception) and pediatric patients, including those with CD. The data consisted of 90,000 single-cell transcriptomes from fetal and pediatric gut biopsies, which were processed using the 10X Genomics platform and allowed for the identification of various epithelial and stromal cell types involved in gut formation and disease pathology.",
