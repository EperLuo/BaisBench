  "hypothesis": "In this research, I investigated the systemic impacts of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a progressive disease characterized by airflow obstruction primarily caused by long-term tobacco smoking. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), I aimed to analyze the cellular variations and inflammatory responses in lung tissues from COPD patients, non-COPD smokers, and never-smokers. I collected a total of 57,755 cells across various patients, which allowed for high-resolution insights into epithelial cell behaviors and interactions within the lung microenvironment in the context of COPD.",
