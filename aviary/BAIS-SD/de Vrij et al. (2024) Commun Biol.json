  "hypothesis": "In this research, I explored the immunological determinants of persistent and recurrent visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in HIV-coinfected patients, focusing on T cell unresponsiveness. The dataset used included peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from chronic VL-HIV patients and non-chronic VL-HIV patients, as well as HIV-only and Leishmania-seropositive groups. We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile the immune cell transcriptomes from these patient groups, with a total of 17,308 cells sequenced.",
