  "hypothesis": "The impact of smoking on airway epithelial cells is well known, but how it modulates the expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry genes (ACE2, TMPRSS2, and CTSL) in different airway compartments remains unclear. Understanding these gene expression patterns in nasal vs. bronchial epithelial cells is crucial for evaluating how smoking affects COVID-19 susceptibility and severity.\n\nTo investigate this, I analyzed scRNA-seq data from nasal and bronchial brushings obtained from individuals undergoing lung cancer screening or diagnostic workups. The dataset includes 34,833 single cells from 9 nasal brushings and 2,075 single cells from 17 bronchial brushings. The sequencing was performed using the 10X Genomics platform for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). These data can be used to define airway epithelial cell subpopulations, assess the impact of smoking on gene expression, and identify changes in cell type proportions across smokers and non-smokers.",
