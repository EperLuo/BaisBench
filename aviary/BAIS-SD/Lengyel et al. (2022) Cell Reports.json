  "hypothesis": "In this research, I set out to create a comprehensive molecular atlas of the postmenopausal fallopian tube (FT) and ovary. The objective was to better understand the cellular compositions and interactions within these organs, especially considering their roles in gynecologic diseases that manifest prominently after menopause. I utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq) to analyze a total of 86,708 cells from postmenopausal women, coming from various anatomic regions of the FT and the ovary. This integration of transcriptomic and regulatory data is intended to enhance our understanding of these tissues at a single-cell resolution.",
