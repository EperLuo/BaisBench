  "hypothesis": "I aimed to investigate the cellular heterogeneity in malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) associated with metastatic breast cancer. MPEs occur frequently in advanced breast cancer, yet their cellular composition and interactions within the pleural microenvironment remain poorly understood. Identifying malignant vs. non-malignant cells, understanding the role of mesothelial cells, and determining patient-level differences in MPE composition can provide insights into breast cancer metastasis.\n\nUsing single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), I analyzed nearly 65,000 cells from 10 pleural effusion samples across seven patients with metastatic breast cancer. The sequencing was performed using the 10X Genomics Chromium platform, with Miltenyi-based negative selection enrichment in some samples. The dataset includes malignant breast cancer cells, mesothelial cells, immune cells (T, NK, B, myeloid cells), and fibroblast-like cells, allowing an unbiased characterization of the pleural tumor microenvironment.",
