  "hypothesis": "I aim to map the spatiotemporal distribution of immune cells in the human kidney to understand how immune function develops and adapts in different anatomical zones. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), I can resolve immune cell diversity, spatial distribution, and transcriptional changes over time. This will help define how immune cells establish renal defense mechanisms and interact with epithelial structures in fetal and mature kidneys.\nSamples: Single-cell suspensions from 14 mature human kidneys and 6 fetal kidneys (7-16 post-conception weeks, PCW).\nCells: 114,113 droplets captured from mature kidneys (yielding 40,268 high-quality cells) and 33,865 droplets from fetal kidneys (yielding 27,203 high-quality cells).\nMethods: Droplet-based scRNA-seq (10x Genomics), flow and mass cytometry.",
