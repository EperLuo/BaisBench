  "hypothesis": "In this study, I created a single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the human retina to identify cell types associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD is a leading cause of blindness in the elderly, and its genetic complexity has made it difficult to pinpoint the specific cell types involved. By applying single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) using two independent platforms (droplet-based microfluidics and Seq-Well), I analyzed human retinal cell types and their gene expression signatures. The dataset includes 23,339 cells from the macula and peripheral retina of six postmortem donors, covering all major retinal cell types.\n",
