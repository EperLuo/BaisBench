  "hypothesis": "In this study, single-cell technologies were applied to examine the immune responses in ileal tissues from patients with Crohn's Disease (CD), particularly focusing on those who have resistance to anti-TNF therapy. CD is an inflammatory bowel disease characterized by chronic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. The authors used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to study cellular heterogeneity in CD lesions. The study included tissue samples from 11 iCD patients with a total of 82,417 lamina propria cells analyzed, which can be used to identify distinct immune and stromal cell types and subtypes that contribute to disease severity and treatment outcomes.",
