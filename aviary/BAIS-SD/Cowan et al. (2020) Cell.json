  "hypothesis": "In my research, I focused on creating a comprehensive understanding of the types and functions of cells within the human retina and its organoids at single-cell resolution. Retinal diseases are leading causes of irreversible blindness, so examining the cellular landscape is essential for developing treatments. I utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze approximately 285,441 transcriptomes from both human retinas and retinal organoids across various developmental stages. The sequencing data provided detailed insights into the diverse cell types present in the retina and how these types relate to known molecular functions and disease mechanisms.",
