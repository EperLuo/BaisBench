  "hypothesis": "In this study, I investigated fibroblast heterogeneity and age-related changes in human skin using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). The focus was on defining fibroblast subpopulations and understanding how their functional priming changes with age. The dataset comprises transcriptomes from 15,457 single cells, including 5,948 fibroblasts, obtained from five male donors (aged 25, 27, 53, 69, and 70 years). The samples were taken from a sun-protected region to minimize photoaging effects. This data aims to identify fibroblast subpopulations, characterized their functions, and analyzed the impact of aging on fibroblast identity and cell\u2013cell interactions.\n",
