  "hypothesis": "In this study, the authors investigated the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, key receptors involved in the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells, in lung and bronchial tissues. They used single-cell and single-nuclei RNA sequencing to explore the transcriptional landscape of these tissues. The goal was to identify specific cell types in the respiratory tract that express these receptors and proteases, which could make them susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The dataset analyzed included lung tissue from twelve individuals (39,778 cell nuclei) and bronchial epithelial cells from four healthy donors (17,521 cells).",
