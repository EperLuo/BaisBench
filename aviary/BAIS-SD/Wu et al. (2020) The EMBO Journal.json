  "hypothesis": "I aim to understand the heterogeneity of stromal cells in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and their role in immune evasion. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is highly complex, and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and perivascular-like (PVL) cells play critical roles in cancer progression. By using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), I can classify distinct stromal subpopulations and their interactions with immune cells, which may contribute to immune suppression and therapeutic resistance.\nSamples: Five primary TNBC tumors.\nCells: 24,271 single cells sequenced with an average of 4,854 cells per patient.\nMethods: 10x Genomics scRNA-seq, flow cytometry, and computational analysis of cell-cell interactions.",
