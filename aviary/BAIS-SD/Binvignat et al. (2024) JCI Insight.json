  "hypothesis": "In this study, I aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying rheumatoid arthritis (RA), focusing specifically on disease activity and the immune system. RA is an autoimmune disorder that causes chronic inflammation and joint damage, but the molecular mechanisms contributing to disease progression remain unclear. My approach involved using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 36 participants\u201418 RA patients and 18 matched controls. The sequencing data consists of 125,698 cells and 22,159 genes from PBMCs, sequenced using the 10X Genomics Chromium system. The patients were stratified into two groups based on disease activity: remission-low disease activity (DAS28-CRP < 3.2) and moderate-high disease activity (DAS28-CRP \u2265 3.2).",
