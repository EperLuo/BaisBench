  "hypothesis": "The research aims to understand follicular remodeling in the adult human ovary, a process that involves the growth and regression of ovarian follicles. The ovary undergoes continuous remodeling throughout a woman\u2019s reproductive years, with follicles maturing, growing, and undergoing atresia (degeneration). This dynamic process is vital for fertility, but the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), the study aimed to map the molecular signatures of the growing and regressing follicular populations in the human ovary, identify the somatic cell types involved, and explore their signaling pathways.\n\nThe sequencing data was obtained from 31 ovarian tissue samples from 5 women undergoing fertility preservation. The samples included growing and atretic (degenerating) follicles. The 10X Genomics platform was used to sequence 56,206 cells, which were filtered for quality and analyzed further, resulting in a final dataset of 20,676 cells representing granulosa cells (GC), theca cells (TC), immune cells, and other ovarian cell types.",
