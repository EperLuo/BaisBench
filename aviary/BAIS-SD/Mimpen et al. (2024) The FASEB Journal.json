  "hypothesis": "In this study, I aimed to better understand the cellular composition and function of healthy human hamstring tendon. Using single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics, I profiled the transcriptomes of 10,533 nuclei from the hamstring tendon of four healthy donors. These technologies allowed me to identify a broad range of cell types within the tendon, including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, skeletal muscle cells, and immune cells. The spatial distribution of these cell types was also mapped, providing insights into how the cells interact and contribute to tendon homeostasis. This comprehensive analysis aims to improve the understanding of tendon biology, with potential applications in the treatment of tendon-related diseases.",
