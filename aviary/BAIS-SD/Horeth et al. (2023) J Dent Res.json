  "hypothesis": "In this research, I aimed to explore the transcriptomic landscape of the human submandibular gland (SMG) to better understand its cellular complexity and functionality. The goal was to elucidate the diverse cellular populations present in the SMG, particularly focusing on the roles of epithelial cells in health and disease. To achieve this, I performed bulk RNA sequencing to obtain a broad overview of gene expression patterns and utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to delve into the intricacies of individual cell types. I collected normal human SMG samples from both male and female adult patients undergoing surgery for unrelated pathologies, leading to the generation of high-quality transcriptomic data.",
