  "hypothesis": "In my research, I focused on understanding the heterogeneity of oligodendrocytes in the human brain, particularly in the context of multiple sclerosis (MS). Oligodendrocytes play a critical role in myelination and support the metabolic needs of axons, making them vital for central nervous system (CNS) function. To investigate this, I utilized single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on post-mortem brain tissue from healthy individuals and MS patients, generating data on 17,799 nuclei isolated from white matter regions. This dataset allowed me to characterize transcriptional differences in oligodendrocytes between healthy and diseased states.",
