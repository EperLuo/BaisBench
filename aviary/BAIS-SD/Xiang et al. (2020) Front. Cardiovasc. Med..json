  "hypothesis": "In this research, we aimed to dissect the complexity and heterogeneity of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in mouse lymph nodes through single-cell transcriptomics. The lymphatic system plays a key role in immune responses and maintaining tissue homeostasis, and understanding the specific functions of these endothelial cells is crucial. The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were obtained from the peripheral lymph nodes of mice, specifically focusing on lymphatic endothelial cell populations, with techniques designed to achieve high-resolution insights into their transcriptional profiles.",
