  "hypothesis": "Oral squamous cell carcinoma of the gingivo-buccal region (OSCC-GB) is one of the most common cancers in India, particularly among men, and is associated with a high rate of recurrence and poor prognosis. Cellular heterogeneity in OSCC-GB tumors plays a crucial role in tumor progression, treatment resistance, and immune evasion, but a detailed characterization of the tumor ecosystem was lacking. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides an opportunity to resolve tumor heterogeneity at a cellular level.\n\nIn this study, I performed scRNA-seq on tumors from 12 OSCC-GB patients, including 3 patients with oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF), a precancerous condition. Using 10X Genomics Chromium platform, I profiled 52,393 cells, retaining 28,186 cells after quality control. The dataset includes malignant epithelial cells, immune cells (T cells, B cells, myeloid cells), fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, allowing an unbiased characterization of OSCC-GB tumor heterogeneity.",
