  "hypothesis": "Lung development is a highly complex process involving a diverse array of cell types, yet our understanding of late-stage human lung development remains incomplete. Animal models have provided critical insights, but translating these findings to human biology is challenging due to species differences. To address this gap, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to create a molecular atlas of newborn human lung cells. This allows us to define distinct cellular populations and their gene signatures, offering new insights into the structural and functional maturation of the human lung at birth.\nSample Source: Two one-day-old newborn human lungs were obtained through organ donation. One was from a full-term infant (38 weeks gestational age), and the other was preterm (31 weeks gestational age).\nCell Isolation & Processing: Lungs were enzymatically digested to obtain single-cell suspensions, which were frozen and later used for sequencing.\nSequencing Platform: Chromium 10X Genomics system (v2 chemistry), sequenced on a HiSeq4000.\nFinal Dataset: 5,499 high-quality cells, including epithelial, endothelial, mesenchymal, and immune cells.",
