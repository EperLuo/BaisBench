  "hypothesis": "In this study, I aimed to explore the molecular changes in the human dorsal striatum associated with opioid use disorder (OUD). The striatum is crucial in reward processing and goal-directed behaviors, and its dysfunction is linked to psychiatric disorders like OUD. I used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to analyze 98,848 nuclei from the caudate and putamen of both unaffected individuals and individuals with OUD. This allowed for a detailed understanding of cell-specific molecular alterations, focusing on changes in neuroinflammation, DNA damage, and oxidative stress pathways. ",
