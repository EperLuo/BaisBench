  "hypothesis": "As a student in bioinformatics, I am interested in understanding how maternal immune cells interact with fetal trophoblasts during early pregnancy and the implications of these interactions on placentation and reproductive outcomes. Our research focuses on uterine natural killer (uNK) cells, which are crucial for facilitating successful implantation and maternal-fetal tolerance. We employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to analyze the transcriptomic profile of uNK cells, aiming to identify specific cytokine signals that influence trophoblast differentiation and function. The sequencing data was derived from matched decidual and fetal tissue samples collected from 19 healthy first-trimester donors.",
