  "hypothesis": "T cells play a crucial role in adaptive immunity, but their function and persistence vary depending on the tissue microenvironment. While blood-derived T cells have been extensively studied, less is known about how T cell function is shaped by tissue-specific contexts such as the lungs, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile more than 50,000 resting and activated T cells from different anatomical sites to understand their transcriptional signatures in homeostasis and activation. Our study establishes a high-resolution reference map of human T cell states across tissues, providing a framework to analyze immune responses in health and disease.\nSample Source: T cells were isolated from lungs, lymph nodes, bone marrow (from two organ donors), and peripheral blood (from two healthy volunteers).\nCell Isolation & Processing: CD3+ T cells were negatively selected, cultured in either resting conditions or activated using anti-CD3/anti-CD28 stimulation.\nSequencing Platform: Chromium 10X Genomics system, sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000.\nFinal Dataset: >50,000 T cells, classified into resting and activated states, across CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subtypes.",
