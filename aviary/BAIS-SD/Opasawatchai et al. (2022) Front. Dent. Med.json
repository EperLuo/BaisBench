  "hypothesis": "Dental caries can cause significant changes in dental pulp, affecting immune responses and tissue repair mechanisms. Understanding how different cell types within the pulp respond to caries at a single-cell resolution is crucial for advancing regenerative dentistry. While bulk transcriptomics has provided insights into global gene expression changes, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows us to identify cellular heterogeneity and interactions that drive disease progression and tissue response. We used scRNA-seq to characterize cell populations and their molecular responses in sound and carious teeth, highlighting immune cell alterations and cell-cell interactions in deep dental caries.\nSample Source: Dental pulp tissues were isolated from one sound human maxillary third molar and three carious teeth (one with enamel caries, two with deep dental caries).\nCell Isolation & Processing: Enzymatic digestion with collagenase and dispase was used to dissociate the dental pulp tissue into single cells.\nSequencing Platform: Chromium 10X Genomics system (v2 chemistry), sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq system.\nFinal Dataset: 6,810 high-quality single cells were analyzed.",
