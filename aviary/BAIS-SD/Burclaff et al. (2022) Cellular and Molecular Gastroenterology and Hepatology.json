  "hypothesis": "In this research, I aimed to create a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the healthy adult human small intestine and colon. The objective was to characterize the cellular diversity and functional roles of epithelial cells throughout the gastrointestinal tract, as few studies have focused on this using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). I utilized scRNA-seq techniques to analyze epithelial cells collected from the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and the ascending, transverse, and descending colon from three healthy organ donors. In total, I processed 12,590 single epithelial cells, generating valuable insights into the organization and functionality of various cell types across the intestinal tract.",
