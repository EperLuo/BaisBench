  "hypothesis": "In this study, I aimed to explore the cellular and molecular dynamics of human small intestine development using a human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived small intestine-on-chip model. The goal was to understand self-organization and tissue maturation processes at the cellular level. To analyze gene expression across various stages of development, I performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on the organoid model. The dataset consists of 30,000 cells from several replicates of iPSC-derived small intestine cultures. This resource provides detailed insights into the transcriptional landscape and cell-type diversity within the small intestine model, which is valuable for understanding both healthy tissue development and disease mechanisms.",
