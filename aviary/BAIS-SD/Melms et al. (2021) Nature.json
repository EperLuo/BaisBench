  "hypothesis": "In this research, I investigated the cellular and molecular responses of the lung during lethal COVID-19. My goal was to provide insights into the host response at the tissue level, which remains poorly understood despite the vast number of COVID-19 cases. I utilized single-nucleus RNA sequencing to analyze approximately 116,000 nuclei from lung tissues of 19 COVID-19 patients who underwent rapid autopsy and 7 control individuals. The integration of this data allows for a detailed characterization of changes in cellular composition, transcriptional states, and potential therapeutic targets.",
