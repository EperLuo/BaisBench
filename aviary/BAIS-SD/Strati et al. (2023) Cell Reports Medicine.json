  "hypothesis": "In this research, the focus is on understanding the mechanisms behind prolonged cytopenia (PC) in patients undergoing CD19 CAR T cell therapy for large B-cell lymphoma (rrLBCL). Prolonged cytopenia, defined as grade 3 or 4 cytopenia persisting beyond 30 days after treatment, is a major side effect that complicates patient recovery. The dataset includes single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of bone marrow aspirates from 16 patients with rrLBCL treated with CAR T therapy, including 11 patients with PC and 5 without. A total of 92,676 cells were analyzed.",
