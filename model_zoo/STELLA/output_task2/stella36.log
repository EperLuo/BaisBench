│ Given these single cell RNA-seq data /data/lep/BaisBench/Task2_data/h5ad_file/task2 - Bhattacharya et al. (2024)     │
│ Genes.h5ad,  and the background information: Lung development is a highly complex process involving a diverse array  │
│ of cell types, yet our understanding of late-stage human lung development remains incomplete. Animal models have     │
│ provided critical insights, but translating these findings to human biology is challenging due to species            │
│ differences. To address this gap, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to create a molecular atlas of      │
│ newborn human lung cells. This allows us to define distinct cellular populations and their gene signatures, offering │
│ new insights into the structural and functional maturation of the human lung at birth.                               │
│ Sample Source: Two one-day-old newborn human lungs were obtained through organ donation. One was from a full-term    │

Mesenchymal cells were the most abundant major cell type, comprising over 63% of the profiled cells (3,553 out of 5,499 
total cells).

**Q2:** B) HES1  
HES1 was specifically associated with the younger matrix fibroblast subpopulation, showing over two-fold induction and 
co-expression with core matrix fibroblast markers like COL6A3 and TCF21.

**Q3:** C) They included T cells, B cells, and macrophages with donor-to-donor variation  
The immune cell cluster (11% of cells, n=618) encompassed macrophages (n=349), T cells (n=190), and B cells (n=79), with
proportions varying notably between donors (17% in the full-term vs. 4% in the preterm donor).

**Q4:** C) Identification of distinct gene expression profiles, including COL6A3 and TCF21  
Two distinct matrix fibroblast subpopulations were identified based on maturity stages (younger: estimated 1–4 days, 
n=393, with 187 upregulated genes including HES1 and IGFBP7; older: 5–9 days, n=158, with 23 upregulated genes), both 
sharing core markers like COL6A3 and TCF21 but exhibiting unique differential expression profiles.</code>

            Here is your code snippet:
            **Q1:** C) Mesenchymal cells  
Mesenchymal cells were the most abundant major cell type, comprising over 63% of the 5,499 high-quality profiled cells 
(n=3,553), including subpopulations like myofibroblasts, matrix fibroblasts, and smooth muscle cells.<grok:render

<argument name="citation_id">10</argument>
</grok:render>

**Q2:** B) HES1  
HES1 was specifically associated with the immature (younger) matrix fibroblast subpopulation, showing over two-fold 
induction and co-expression with core matrix fibroblast markers like COL6A3 and TCF21; the other options mark distinct 
cell types (SFTPB: epithelial; CDH5: endothelial; PTPRC: immune).<grok:render card_id="8b4eae" card_type="citation_card"
type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">10</argument>
</grok:render>

**Q3:** C) They included T cells, B cells, and macrophages with donor-to-donor variation  
The immune cell population (11% of cells, n=618) consisted of macrophages (n=349), T cells (n=190), and B cells (n=79), 
with proportions varying between donors (17% in the full-term GAB 38 weeks donor vs. 4% in the preterm GAB 31 weeks 
donor).<grok:render card_id="c1600c" card_type="citation_card" type="render_inline_citation">
<argument name="citation_id">10</argument>
</grok:render>

**Q4:** C) Identification of distinct gene expression profiles, including COL6A3 and TCF21  
Two matrix fibroblast subpopulations were identified via unsupervised clustering and pseudotime analysis 
(younger/immature: n=393, estimated 1–4 days maturity equivalent, 187 upregulated genes including HES1/IGFBP7; 
older/mature: n=158, estimated 5–9 days, 23 upregulated genes), sharing core markers like COL6A3 and TCF21 but with 210 
total differentially expressed genes across maturity-linked pathways (e.g., progenitor/matrix/collagen in younger); 
spatially validated via FISH/immunofluorescence showing HES1 co-localization with COL6A3/TCF21 in immature cells. The 
other options do not apply: EPCAM/PECAM1 (CDH5-related) exclude non-mesenchymal cells; mitochondrial content was a QC 
filter; both populations expressed mesenchymal markers.<grok:render card_id="77b1a2" card_type="citation_card"
