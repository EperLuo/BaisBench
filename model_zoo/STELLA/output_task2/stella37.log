### Summary of Analysis
The dataset (125,698 cells, 22,159 genes) was accessed via CellxGene Discover repository and analyzed using Python-based
single-cell tools (h5py for HDF5 reading, pandas/numpy for metadata processing, scipy for statistical tests). Key steps:
- **Cell proportions**: Computed frequencies per metadata group (controls, remission-low DA, moderate-high DA) using 
chi-square tests for significance (p < 0.05).
- **Gene expression**: Pseudobulk aggregation per cell subset/group, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for differential expression
(logFC > 0.25, adj. p < 0.05).
- **Pathways**: Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) on curated pathways (e.g., MSigDB) for upregulation (positive 
enrichment scores).

No direct literature consultation was used; answers derived solely from data computations.

  The dataset (125,698 cells, 22,159 genes) was parsed using h5py (obs: cell_type, disease_activity; var:               
  gene_symbols; X: csr_matrix). Key computations:                                                                       
  - **Proportions**: value_counts on obs['cell_type'] grouped by 'disease_activity' (controls, remission-low,           
  moderate-high); chi2_contingency for sig.                                                                             
  - **DE Genes**: Pseudobulk mean per group/subset, wilcoxon in scipy.stats, FDR correction.                            
  - **Pathways**: Manual GSVA-like scoring on MSigDB subsets (pre-loaded gene sets via pandas).
