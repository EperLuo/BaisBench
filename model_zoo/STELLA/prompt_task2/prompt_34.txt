Given these single cell RNA-seq data /data/lep/BaisBench/Task2_data/h5ad_file/task2 - Xiang et al. (2020) Front. Cardiovasc. Med. - mouse.h5ad, /data/lep/BaisBench/Task2_data/h5ad_file/task2 - Xiang et al. (2020) Front. Cardiovasc. Med. - human.h5ad,  and the background information: In this research, we aimed to dissect the complexity and heterogeneity of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) in mouse lymph nodes through single-cell transcriptomics. The lymphatic system plays a key role in immune responses and maintaining tissue homeostasis, and understanding the specific functions of these endothelial cells is crucial. The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data were obtained from the peripheral lymph nodes of mice, specifically focusing on lymphatic endothelial cell populations, with techniques designed to achieve high-resolution insights into their transcriptional profiles. , analysis the data to answer the following questions: Q1: The trajectory analysis of the data indicated transitions from which types of LECs?
A) Only from fLECs to cLECs
B) fLECs to Marco-LECs and Ptx3-LECs
C) cLECs to fLECs
D) fLECs to blood endothelial cells
Q2: In the data, what specialized gene expression profile is associated with cLECs?
A) High expression of immune checkpoint ligands
B) High expression of extracellular matrix proteins
C) High expression of angiogenic factors
D) High expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines
Q3: What immune responses were notably upregulated in fLECs and Ptx3-LECs during inflammation in the data?
A) Chemotactic factors for T cells
B) Interferon-responsive genes
C) Adhesion molecules for neutrophil recruitment
D) Antigen presentation markers
Q4: The integration of mouse and human LEC profiles demonstrated what aspect about lymphatic vascular niches?
A) Unique profiles with no conserved elements
B) Completely divergent functions across species
C) Conserved patterns across species
D) Exclusive characteristics unique to mice
