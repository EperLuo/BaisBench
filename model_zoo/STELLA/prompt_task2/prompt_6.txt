Given these single cell RNA-seq data /data/lep/BaisBench/Task2_data/h5ad_file/task2 - Guerrero-Murillo et al. (2024) bioRxiv.h5ad,  and the background information: In this study, the authors investigate the immune response dynamics of CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). The main goal was to identify factors that drive the therapeutic efficacy of CAR-T cells, focusing on the differences between CAR-positive (CARpos) and CAR-negative (CARneg) T cells. The authors integrated single-cell transcriptomic and clonal data to explore the behavior of both CARpos and CARneg T cells, tracking their response across different time points—specifically in the infusion product (IP) and at the peak of CAR-T cell expansion post-infusion.
The sequencing data consist of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell T-cell receptor sequencing (sc-αβTCR-seq), which were used to analyze 38,190 T cells from five B-ALL patients. The dataset included CARpos and CARneg T cell populations from both the IP and peak expansion phases. The study provides valuable insights into the transcriptional profiles, clonal diversity, and functional states of these cells. , analysis the data to answer the following questions: Q1: Which T cell subset was significantly expanded at the peak of CAR-T cell expansion in the data?
A) CD4+ T cells
B) γδT cells
C) CD8+ effector cytotoxic T cells
D) CD4+ effector memory T cells
Q2: What did the data reveal about the CD4:CD8 ratio in CARpos T cells at the expansion peak?
A) It was higher than in the infusion product (IP).
B) It was significantly lower than in the infusion product (IP).
C) It remained constant during expansion.
D) It was unrelated to clinical outcomes.
Q3: Which of the following is true regarding the γδT cell population in the data?
A) γδT cells lacked αβTCR and were expanded at the peak.
B) γδT cells were a minor population in both CARpos and CARneg fractions.
C) γδT cells were exclusively detected in CARneg populations.
D) γδT cells exhibited low cytotoxic activity at the expansion peak.
Q4: What was the association between T cell exhaustion signatures and patient outcomes?
A) Higher exhaustion scores were linked to better clinical outcomes.
B) Higher exhaustion scores were associated with early relapse in patients.
C) Exhaustion scores were unrelated to relapse or survival.
D) Lower exhaustion scores were associated with early relapse.
