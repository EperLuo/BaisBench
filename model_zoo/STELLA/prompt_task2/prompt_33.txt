Given these single cell RNA-seq data /data/lep/BaisBench/Task2_data/h5ad_file/task2 - Jäkel et al. (2019) Nature.h5ad,  and the background information: In my research, I focused on understanding the heterogeneity of oligodendrocytes in the human brain, particularly in the context of multiple sclerosis (MS). Oligodendrocytes play a critical role in myelination and support the metabolic needs of axons, making them vital for central nervous system (CNS) function. To investigate this, I utilized single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on post-mortem brain tissue from healthy individuals and MS patients, generating data on 17,799 nuclei isolated from white matter regions. This dataset allowed me to characterize transcriptional differences in oligodendrocytes between healthy and diseased states. , analysis the data to answer the following questions: Q1: How many main sub-clusters of oligodendrocytes were identified in the healthy human white matter according to the data?
A) 3
B) 5
C) 9
D) 13
Q2: Which marker gene was specifically identified for oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) in the data?
A) OLIG1
B) BCAN
C) MAFB
D) KLK6
Q3: What characteristic was observed in multiple sclerosis lesions regarding oligodendrocyte populations?
A) Depletion of mature oligodendrocyte states
B) Increased OPC abundance
C) Similar abundances of all oligodendrocyte types as control
D) Presence of OPCs only
Q4: Which type of expression profile was found to be increased in a subset of oligodendrocytes in multiple sclerosis according to the data?
A) Insulin signaling genes
B) Apoptosis-related genes
C) DNA repair genes
D) Myelinating genes
Q5: The transcription factors associated with oligodendrocyte identity showed greater conservation between which two species as observed in the data?
A) Human and mouse
B) Human and pig
C) Pig and mouse
D) Human and dog
