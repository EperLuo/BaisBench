Given these single cell RNA-seq data /data/lep/BaisBench/Task2_data/h5ad_file/task2 - Yang et al. (2021) Nature.h5ad,  and the background information: In this research, I aimed to explore the neurological effects of severe COVID-19 by examining changes in brain and choroid plexus cell types. Given the reported neurological symptoms in COVID-19 patients, it was crucial to understand the cellular and molecular alterations occurring in the brain following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We utilized single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to analyze a large dataset consisting of 65,309 single-nucleus transcriptomes from post-mortem brain samples taken from both control individuals and patients who had died from COVID-19. , analysis the data to answer the following questions: Q1: What did the data reveal regarding SARS-CoV-2 presence in the brain samples?
A) No SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in brain samples.
B) SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in every sample.
C) SARS-CoV-2 was found only in patients with severe neurological symptoms.
D) SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid but not in brain tissue.
Q2: According to the data, which cell types exhibit a unique transcriptional profile in patients with COVID-19?
A) Ependymal cells
B) Microglia and astrocytes
C) Oligodendrocytes
D) Neurons only
Q3: What specific effect on upper-layer excitatory neurons is mentioned in the data?
A) Upregulation of synaptic genes
B) Increased proliferation
C) No effect observed
D) Downregulation of synaptic genes
Q4: The data suggest that the communication between which two regions is significantly altered in COVID-19?
A) Choroid plexus and hippocampus
B) Choroid plexus and medial frontal cortex
C) Thalamus and lateral ventricles
D) Brainstem and spinal cord
Q5: What is the relationship between the DEGs identified in COVID-19 and known pathways in other diseases? (Select multiple answers)
A) DEGs overlap with pathways in Alzheimer’s disease.
B) DEGs show identical patterns as in healthy brains.
C) DEGs are related to chronic inflammatory conditions.
D) DEGs are linked to neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment.
