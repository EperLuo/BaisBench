(2020) Journal of Experimental Medicine - Colon.h5ad,  and the background information: In this research, I aimed to investigate the nutrient absorption functions of the human intestine by analyzing intestinal epithelial cells from the human ileum, colon, and rectum. The human intestine plays a crucial role in the digestion and absorption of nutrients, but the specific cellular mechanisms, especially differences across intestinal regions, remain largely unclear. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), I profiled 14,537 epithelial cells from human ileum, colon, and rectum obtained from six donors (two per region) to better understand nutrient absorption functions in the small and large intestine and to identify potential new marker genes for various cell types involved in these processes.
The sequencing was done using the 10X Genomics platform, producing high-quality transcriptomic data, which allowed me to perform detailed analyses of gene expression in different regions of the human gut. The key findings from these analyses help define the roles of different intestinal cell types in nutrient absorption, including Paneth-like cells (PLCs) in the large intestine, and new markers for transient-amplifying (TA) cells and goblet cells.
