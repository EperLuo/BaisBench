Given these single cell RNA-seq data /data/lep/BaisBench/Task2_data/h5ad_file/task2 - Melms et al. (2021) Nature.h5ad,  and the background information: In this research, I investigated the cellular and molecular responses of the lung during lethal COVID-19. My goal was to provide insights into the host response at the tissue level, which remains poorly understood despite the vast number of COVID-19 cases. I utilized single-nucleus RNA sequencing to analyze approximately 116,000 nuclei from lung tissues of 19 COVID-19 patients who underwent rapid autopsy and 7 control individuals. The integration of this data allows for a detailed characterization of changes in cellular composition, transcriptional states, and potential therapeutic targets. , analysis the data to answer the following questions: Q1: What major cell types were identified in the lungs of COVID-19 patients based on single-nucleus RNA sequencing data?
A) Epithelial cells
B) Fibroblasts
C) Neuronal cells
D) Myeloid cells
E) Smooth muscle cells
Q2: Which cell type exhibited a significant reduction in COVID-19 lungs compared to control lungs?
A) Alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells
B) Endothelial cells
C) Mast cells
D) Plasma cells
Q3: What marker genes were used to identify damage-associated transient progenitors (DATPs) in the alveolar epithelium?
A) KRT8, CLDN4, CDKN1A
B) ACE2, TMPRSS2
C) PDGFRA, COL1A1
D) IL-6, TNF-alpha
Q4: Which of the following statements about the findings related to myeloid cells and inflammation in COVID-19 are true?
A) Aberrant activation of macrophages was observed in COVID-19 patients.
B) Immune response markers were absent in macrophages from patients with COVID-19.
C) Macrophages in COVID-19 lungs expressed interleukin-1β at higher levels than controls.
D) The proportion of monocytes decreased in COVID-19 lungs compared to controls.
Q5: What conclusion can be drawn about T cell responses in the lungs of individuals who died of COVID-19?
A) T cell populations were significantly increased.
B) There was an adequate CD8+ T cell response.
C) T cell responses were inadequate despite an adequate humoral immune response.
D) Circulating T cells showed no response to the infection.
