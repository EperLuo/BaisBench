Given these single cell RNA-seq data /data/lep/BaisBench/Task2_data/h5ad_file/task2 - Wiedemann et al. (2023) Cell Reports.h5ad,  and the background information: In my research, I focused on understanding the unique characteristics of human palmoplantar skin compared to non-palmoplantar skin, particularly the hip region. Palmoplantar skin plays a crucial role in providing mechanical resistance due to its specialized structure. However, the cellular and transcriptional programs that differentiate this skin type from others are not well understood. I utilized both bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) from skin biopsies, which allowed me to explore the distinct cellular and molecular environments in different skin sites. The sequencing dataset included samples from 15 healthy individuals, with a total of 30 biopsies from palm, sole, and hip. , analysis the data to answer the following questions: Q1: What major cell types were identified in the single-cell transcriptome data from the skin samples?
A) Myocytes
B) Immune cells
C) Melanocytes
D) Keratinocytes, fibroblasts
Q2: What significant change in immune cell populations was observed between palmoplantar and non-palmoplantar skin?
A) Increased T cell populations in palmoplantar skin
B) Reduced immune cell populations in palmoplantar skin
C) Increased B cell populations in non-palmoplantar skin
D) No significant differences in immune cell populations
Q3: What distinct feature was noted about the keratinocytes in the sole as compared to the palm?
A) Higher expression of KRT9 in the sole
B) Greater fraction of basal keratinocytes in the sole
C) Stronger immune signaling in sole keratinocytes
D) Increased differentiation into granular cells in the palm
Q4: Which of the following statements is true regarding the spinous keratinocyte populations identified in the data?
A) Both spinous populations exhibit identical functions and expressions.
B) Spinous I was found to have upregulated oxidative phosphorylation pathways.
C) The spinous keratinocyte populations culminate in a shared terminal differentiation state.
D) Spinous II markers show low expression of differentiation genes.
