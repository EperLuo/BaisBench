Given these single cell RNA-seq data /data/lep/BaisBench/Task2_data/h5ad_file/task2 - Rabadam et al. (2024) JCI Insight.h5ad,  and the background information: In my research, I aimed to understand the immune dysregulation in juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) using single-cell transcriptomics. This autoimmune disorder is characterized by a type I interferon response and specific autoantibodies, but the mechanisms behind its pathogenesis remain unclear. By analyzing the peripheral blood of patients at different disease stages, the data revealed critical insights into the cellular interactions that contribute to JDM. The sequencing data encompassed single-cell RNA sequencing combined with surface protein expression profiling from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of 15 JDM patients, totaling 22 samples, alongside data from 5 healthy controls. , analysis the data to answer the following questions: Q1: What specific B cell population was skewed toward an immature state in treatment-naive JDM patients?
A) Memory B cells
B) Germinal center B cells
C) Naive B cells (B_naive1)
D) Plasmablasts
Q2: Which immune cell type was found to have increased proportions of Tregs in the treatment-naive JDM patients?
A) CD8+ T cells
B) B cells
C) CD4+ T cells
D) NK cells
Q3: In the data, what does the high expression of SIGLEC-1 in CD14+ monocytes indicate?
A) High cytotoxic activity
B) Enhanced antibody production
C) Type I interferon response
D) Decreased inflammation
Q4: Which gene expression profiles were persistently elevated even in inactive JDM?
A) CD1C and CCR5
B) GATA3 and PRDM1
C) INF-γ and TNF-α
D) PDL-1 and CTLA-4
