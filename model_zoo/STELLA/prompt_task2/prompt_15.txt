Given these single cell RNA-seq data /data/lep/BaisBench/Task2_data/h5ad_file/task2 - Strati et al. (2023) Cell Reports Medicine.h5ad,  and the background information: In this research, the focus is on understanding the mechanisms behind prolonged cytopenia (PC) in patients undergoing CD19 CAR T cell therapy for large B-cell lymphoma (rrLBCL). Prolonged cytopenia, defined as grade 3 or 4 cytopenia persisting beyond 30 days after treatment, is a major side effect that complicates patient recovery. The dataset includes single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of bone marrow aspirates from 16 patients with rrLBCL treated with CAR T therapy, including 11 patients with PC and 5 without. A total of 92,676 cells were analyzed. , analysis the data to answer the following questions: Q1: Which subset of CD8 T cells was found to be significantly over-represented in bone marrow samples from patients with prolonged cytopenia (PC)?
A. CX3CR1lo CD8 T cells
B. CX3CR1hi CD8 T cells
C. Naive CD8 T cells
D. Memory CD8 T cells
Q2: What was the most significantly enriched pathway in bone marrow CD8 T cells from patients with PC?
A. T cell receptor signaling
B. IFN-γ response
C. DNA repair pathways
D. Apoptotic signaling
Q3: Which of the following was a key feature of the CX3CR1hi CD8 T cell population in patients with prolonged cytopenia?
A. They expressed high levels of IL-6
B. They expressed high levels of granzymes (GZMA/B) and IFN-γ
C. They were found predominantly in the lymph nodes
D. They lacked expression of TCR
Q4: Which therapeutic approaches could potentially target the mechanisms of CAR T-cell therapy-associated prolonged cytopenia? (Multiple answers possible)
A. Use of IFN-γ-neutralizing antibodies
B. Administration of eltrombopag
C. Chemotherapy targeting T cells
D. Activation of CD8 T cells using immune checkpoint inhibitors
