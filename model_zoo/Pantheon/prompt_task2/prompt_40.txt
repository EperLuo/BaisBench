 Given these single cell RNA-seq data /data/lep/BaisBench/Task2_data/h5ad_file/task2 - de Vrij et al. (2024) Commun Biol - Cross-sectional.h5ad, /data/lep/BaisBench/Task2_data/h5ad_file/task2 - de Vrij et al. (2024) Commun Biol - Longitudinal w treatment.h5ad,  and the background information: In this research, I explored the immunological determinants of persistent and recurrent visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in HIV-coinfected patients, focusing on T cell unresponsiveness. The dataset used included peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from chronic VL-HIV patients and non-chronic VL-HIV patients, as well as HIV-only and Leishmania-seropositive groups. We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to profile the immune cell transcriptomes from these patient groups, with a total of 17,308 cells sequenced. , analysis the data to answer the following questions: Q1: Which exhaustion marker was found to be persistently elevated on both CD8+ and CD8- T cells in chronic VL-HIV patients?
A. PD-1
B. TIM-3
C. TIGIT
D. LAG-3
Q2: What was the key difference in T cell responses between chronic and non-chronic VL-HIV patients after parasitological treatment?
A. Non-chronic VL-HIV patients showed higher expression of PD-1
B. Chronic VL-HIV patients exhibited a lack of T cell clonal expansion
C. Both chronic and non-chronic VL-HIV patients had similar T cell responses
D. Non-chronic VL-HIV patients had a higher frequency of TIGIT+ T cells
Q3: Which of the following statements is true regarding T cell functionality in chronic VL-HIV patients as shown by the data?
A. Chronic VL-HIV patients had increased IFN-γ production by TIGIT+ T cells
B. Chronic VL-HIV patients showed normal T cell activation
C. Chronic VL-HIV patients had lower functionality in TIGIT+ T cells compared to non-chronic patients
D. Chronic VL-HIV patients had higher CD8+ T cell counts compared to non-chronic patients
Q4: Which gene pathway was upregulated in CD4+ T cells of non-chronic VL-HIV patients after treatment, indicating restored T cell activation?
A. T cell receptor signaling
B. Interferon gamma response
C. Antigen processing and presentation
D. Mitochondrial dysfunction
Q5: Which of the following conclusions can be drawn from the data regarding T cell exhaustion in chronic VL-HIV patients? (Multiple answers possible)
A. High levels of PD-1 and TIGIT were observed on T cells throughout the disease course
B. Chronic VL-HIV patients showed a complete lack of T cell functionality after treatment
C. Non-chronic VL-HIV patients had higher frequencies of T cells expressing PD-1 and TIGIT
D. T cell exhaustion markers were reversible in chronic VL-HIV patients with treatment
