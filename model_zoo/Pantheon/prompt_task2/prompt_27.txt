 Given these single cell RNA-seq data /data/lep/BaisBench/Task2_data/h5ad_file/task2 - Lavaert et al. (2020) Immunity.h5ad,  and the background information: The article investigates the identity and regulatory dynamics of human thymus-seeding progenitors (TSPs) during postnatal thymopoiesis. These progenitors are critical for T cell development in the thymus, and the study focuses on understanding their transcriptional landscapes and differentiation processes. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of approximately 70,000 CD34+ thymocytes from five donors, ranging from 2 to 24 months old, the study identifies two distinct TSP subsets (TSP1 and TSP2). The data integrates multiple datasets, including the Human Cell Atlas (HCA), to provide a detailed view of thymocyte differentiation and development. , analysis the data to answer the following questions: Q1: Which of the following surface markers is used to distinguish TSP1 and TSP2 populations in the data?
A. CD44
B. CD10
C. CD7
D. CD34
Q2: Which of the following non-T lineage cells can TSP2 progenitors differentiate into? (Multiple answers possible)
A. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs)
B. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells
C. Conventional dendritic cells (cDC1 and cDC2)
D. Natural killer cells
Q3: During early T cell development, which transcription factor was found to increase significantly, indicating T-lineage commitment?
A. BCL11B
B. GATA3
C. TCF7
D. MYC
Q4: What role does Notch signaling play in the development of TSP1?
A. Induces TSP1 to enter the G1 phase
B. Activates CD7 expression in TSP1
C. Reduces the expression of T-lineage genes
D. Inhibits the differentiation of TSP1 into T-lineage cells
Q5: Which of the following transcription factors is predicted to play a critical role in the differentiation of TSP1 progenitors into T-lineage cells? (Multiple answers possible)
A. SPI1
B. TCF7
C. BCL11A
D. IRF8
