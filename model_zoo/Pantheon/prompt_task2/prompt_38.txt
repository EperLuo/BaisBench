 Given these single cell RNA-seq data /data/lep/BaisBench/Task2_data/h5ad_file/task2 - Lengyel et al. (2022) Cell Reports - Ovary.h5ad, /data/lep/BaisBench/Task2_data/h5ad_file/task2 - Lengyel et al. (2022) Cell Reports - Fallopian tube.h5ad,  and the background information: In this research, I set out to create a comprehensive molecular atlas of the postmenopausal fallopian tube (FT) and ovary. The objective was to better understand the cellular compositions and interactions within these organs, especially considering their roles in gynecologic diseases that manifest prominently after menopause. I utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and single-cell assay for transposase-accessible chromatin sequencing (scATAC-seq) to analyze a total of 86,708 cells from postmenopausal women, coming from various anatomic regions of the FT and the ovary. This integration of transcriptomic and regulatory data is intended to enhance our understanding of these tissues at a single-cell resolution. , analysis the data to answer the following questions: Q1: What is the predominant cell type identified in the postmenopausal fallopian tube?
A) Endothelial cells
B) Epithelial cells
C) Stromal cells
D) Immune cells
Q2: Which ovarian cancer risk-associated genes were expressed by fallopian tube epithelial cells according to the data?
A) TP53 and BRCA1
B) CCDC170, RND3, TACC2, STK33, and ADGB
C) CENPF and CCNB1
D) KRAS and BRAF
Q3: The interaction between which two types of cells in the fallopian tube and ovary was shown to be significant in the ligand-receptor analysis?
A) Stromal and macrophage cells
B) Ciliated epithelial and secretory epithelial cells
C) Endothelial and smooth muscle cells
D) Secretory epithelial and ovarian stromal cells
Q4: How many major cell types were identified in the ovary using single-cell RNA sequencing? 
A) 8
B) 6
C) 11
D) 4
Q5: Which conclusion about the age-related gene expressions was drawn from the analysis?
A) All cell types in the ovary are quiescent.
B) Aging-related genes were absent in the ovarian stroma.
C) SASP-associated genes were found in both the FT and ovarian stromal cells.
D) There is no significant change in gene expression as women age.
