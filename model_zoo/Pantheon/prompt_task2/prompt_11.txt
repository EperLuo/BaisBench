 Given these single cell RNA-seq data /data/lep/BaisBench/Task2_data/h5ad_file/task2 - Wu et al. (2020) The EMBO Journal.h5ad,  and the background information: I aim to understand the heterogeneity of stromal cells in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and their role in immune evasion. The tumor microenvironment (TME) is highly complex, and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and perivascular-like (PVL) cells play critical roles in cancer progression. By using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), I can classify distinct stromal subpopulations and their interactions with immune cells, which may contribute to immune suppression and therapeutic resistance.
Samples: Five primary TNBC tumors.
Cells: 24,271 single cells sequenced with an average of 4,854 cells per patient.
Methods: 10x Genomics scRNA-seq, flow cytometry, and computational analysis of cell-cell interactions. , analysis the data to answer the following questions: Q1: Which of the following transcriptional features distinguish inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs) in TNBC?
A) High expression of ACTA2 and COL1A1
B) Enrichment for CXCL12 and CXCL13
C) Upregulation of muscle-related genes such as MYH11
D) Absence of growth factor signaling genes
Q2: Which ligand-receptor interaction is predicted to contribute to immune evasion in TNBC based on the transcriptomic data?
A) CXCL12 from iCAFs interacting with CXCR4 on T cells
B) IL6 from cancer cells binding to IL6R on T cells
C) VEGFA from myCAFs promoting angiogenesis through VEGFR1
D) CXCL10 from PVL cells binding to CXCR3 on dendritic cells
Q3: How do perivascular-like (PVL) cells in TNBC differ from traditional pericytes?
A) PVL cells express endothelial markers such as PECAM1.
B) PVL cells are exclusively associated with blood vessels.
C) PVL cells express genes related to muscle contractility and adhesion.
D) PVL cells have no functional role in immune regulation.
Q4: Which of the following findings about the tumor microenvironment in TNBC is supported by transcriptomic data?
A) MyCAFs contribute to immune evasion by recruiting CD8+ T cells.
B) dPVL cells correlate with reduced cytotoxic T-cell infiltration in TNBC.
C) iCAFs express PD-L1, which enhances T-cell activation.
D) The tumor microenvironment is exclusively composed of epithelial and immune cells.
Q5: Which pathway is highly expressed in iCAFs and is associated with tumor growth and immune regulation?
A) WNT signaling
B) Hedgehog signaling
C) JAK-STAT pathway
D) BMP and FGF signaling
