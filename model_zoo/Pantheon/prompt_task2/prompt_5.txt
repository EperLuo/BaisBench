 Given these single cell RNA-seq data /data/lep/BaisBench/Task2_data/h5ad_file/task2 - Watanabe et al. (2022) Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol.h5ad,  and the background information: In this research, I investigated the systemic impacts of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a progressive disease characterized by airflow obstruction primarily caused by long-term tobacco smoking. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), I aimed to analyze the cellular variations and inflammatory responses in lung tissues from COPD patients, non-COPD smokers, and never-smokers. I collected a total of 57,755 cells across various patients, which allowed for high-resolution insights into epithelial cell behaviors and interactions within the lung microenvironment in the context of COPD. , analysis the data to answer the following questions: Q1: How many distinct cell clusters were identified as epithelial lineages according to the data?
A) 3
B) 4
C) 5
D) 6
Q2: Which specific marker gene was associated with the inflammatory AT2 (iAT2) cell population?
A) ALB
B) SFTPC
C) PD-L1
D) KRT5
Q3: In the data, what was observed about the AT2 cell in COPD patients?
A) The population increased significantly.
B) The expression of CXCL1 and CXCL8 increased significantly.
C) It remained constant.
D) It was absent.
Q4: Which of the following pathways was found to be significantly activated in COPD iAT2 cells according to the analysis?
A) Oxidative phosphorylation
B) regulation of TNFR1 signaling
C) TNF signaling
D) IFN-α/β signaling
