 Given these single cell RNA-seq data /data/lep/BaisBench/Task2_data/h5ad_file/task2 - Lukassen et al. (2020) The EMBO Journal - respiratory airway.h5ad, /data/lep/BaisBench/Task2_data/h5ad_file/task2 - Lukassen et al. (2020) The EMBO Journal - lung.h5ad,  and the background information: In this study, the authors investigated the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, key receptors involved in the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into human cells, in lung and bronchial tissues. They used single-cell and single-nuclei RNA sequencing to explore the transcriptional landscape of these tissues. The goal was to identify specific cell types in the respiratory tract that express these receptors and proteases, which could make them susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The dataset analyzed included lung tissue from twelve individuals (39,778 cell nuclei) and bronchial epithelial cells from four healthy donors (17,521 cells). , analysis the data to answer the following questions: Q1: Which of the following cell types showed the highest ACE2 expression in the lung tissue?
A) Ciliated cells
B) Club cells
C) Alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells
D) Secretory3 cells
Q2: Which of the following cell populations was found to express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in the bronchial branches?
A) Ciliated cells
B) Transient secretory cells
C) Goblet cells
D) Club cells
Q3: What percentage of ACE2+ transient secretory cells in the lung and bronchial tissues co-expressed TMPRSS2?
A) 25%
B) 50%
C) 40%
D) 10%
Q4: Which of the following factors were found to co-express with ACE2 in lung and bronchial cells?
A) TMPRSS2
B) FURIN
C) RHO GTPases
D) FOXN4
Q5: Which of the following conclusions can be drawn from the expression data of ACE2, TMPRSS2, and FURIN in the respiratory tract?
A) The increased expression of FURIN might enhance the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 by facilitating spike protein priming.
B) The presence of FURIN leads to a reduction in viral infection efficiency.
C) FURIN expression exclusively correlates with lung inflammation.
D) FURIN expression does not affect the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2.
