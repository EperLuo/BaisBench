 Given these single cell RNA-seq data /data/lep/BaisBench/Task2_data/h5ad_file/task2 - Phan et al. (2024) Nat Commun.h5ad,  and the background information: In this study, I aimed to explore the molecular changes in the human dorsal striatum associated with opioid use disorder (OUD). The striatum is crucial in reward processing and goal-directed behaviors, and its dysfunction is linked to psychiatric disorders like OUD. I used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to analyze 98,848 nuclei from the caudate and putamen of both unaffected individuals and individuals with OUD. This allowed for a detailed understanding of cell-specific molecular alterations, focusing on changes in neuroinflammation, DNA damage, and oxidative stress pathways.  , analysis the data to answer the following questions: Q1: Which of the following neuronal subtypes in the striatum showed the highest DNA damage markers in individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD)?
A) D1-striosome neurons
B) D2-matrix neurons
C) Interneurons
D) D1/D2-hybrid neurons
Q2: Which of the following pathways were significantly upregulated in glial cells of individuals with OUD?
A) Interferon response
B) DNA replication
C) Synaptic signaling
D) Mitochondrial respiration
Q3: Which opioid receptor was detected in microglia across individuals in the study?
A) OPRM1
B) OPRD1
C) OPRK1
D) Both A and B
Q4: What transcription factor-regulatory module was highly enriched in D1/D2-hybrid medium spiny neurons (MSNs) related to opioid use disorder (OUD)?
A) ZNF83
B) RXRG
C) FOXP2
D) RUNX1
Q5: What were the sex-specific transcriptional differences in individuals with OUD compared to unaffected individuals?
A) More DEGs in glial cells in females with OUD
B) More DEGs in neurons in males with OUD
C) Upregulation of DNA repair in males with OUD
D) Increased interferon response in neurons in females
