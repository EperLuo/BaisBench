 Given these single cell RNA-seq data /data/lep/BaisBench/Task2_data/h5ad_file/task2 - Solé-Boldo et al. (2020) Commun Biol.h5ad,  and the background information: In this study, I investigated fibroblast heterogeneity and age-related changes in human skin using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). The focus was on defining fibroblast subpopulations and understanding how their functional priming changes with age. The dataset comprises transcriptomes from 15,457 single cells, including 5,948 fibroblasts, obtained from five male donors (aged 25, 27, 53, 69, and 70 years). The samples were taken from a sun-protected region to minimize photoaging effects. This data aims to identify fibroblast subpopulations, characterized their functions, and analyzed the impact of aging on fibroblast identity and cell–cell interactions.

D) Increased expression of SAASP family genes
Q3: Which collagen genes were highly expressed in secretory-reticular fibroblasts?
A) COL18A1
B) COL11A1
C) COL13A1
D) COL24A1
Q4: Which of the following statements about fibroblast aging are supported by the transcriptomic data?
A) The expression profiles from old fibroblasts indicate a significant delay at the G1/S transition of the cell cycle in the pro-inflammatory and secretory-papillary subpopulations
B) Aging fibroblasts exhibit reduced expression of inflammatory cytokines
C) Fibroblast aging leads to reduced ECM gene expression
D) Aging fibroblasts show increased interactions with keratinocytes
Q5: Which fibroblast subpopulation was closely associated with the vasculature?
A) Secretory-reticular fibroblasts
B) Mesenchymal fibroblasts
C) Pro-inflammatory fibroblasts
D) Secretory-papillary fibroblasts
