 Given these single cell RNA-seq data /data/lep/BaisBench/Task2_data/h5ad_file/task2 - Knight-Schrijver et al. (2022) Nat Cardiovasc Res.h5ad,  and the background information: In this study, we aimed to compare the cellular composition and transcriptional programs of adult and fetal human tissues using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). The development and differentiation of cell types in fetal tissues play a crucial role in understanding how adult organs maintain homeostasis and respond to disease. By analyzing both adult and fetal cells at single-cell resolution, we can identify key developmental trajectories and molecular differences that distinguish these stages. The dataset consists of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from adult and fetal human tissues, covering major organ systems. A total of 80000 cells were sequenced, allowing for detailed comparisons of gene expression profiles, lineage hierarchies, and functional characteristics between fetal and adult cells. , analysis the data to answer the following questions: Q1: Which key difference was observed between fetal and adult endothelial cells based on single-cell transcriptomic data?
A) Adult endothelial cells have greater proliferation potential
B) Adult endothelial cells exhibit higher metabolic activity
C) Fetal endothelial cells are more responsive to immune signals
D) Fetal endothelial cells express higher levels of angiogenic factors
Q2: What was a key difference in immune cell composition between fetal and adult tissues?
A) Adult immune cells have more diverse subtype distributions
B) Fetal immune cells are more resistant to apoptosis
C) Adult immune cells exhibit stronger cell proliferation signatures
D) Fetal immune cells exclusively rely on adaptive immunity
Q3: Which of the following transcriptional features distinguished adult epithelial cells from fetal epithelial cells?
A) Fetal epithelial cells express higher levels of tissue remodeling genes
B) Adult epithelial cells exhibit stronger barrier function gene expression
C) Adult epithelial cells have higher expression of cell cycle regulators
D) Fetal epithelial cells rely more on oxidative phosphorylation
Q4: Based on a combination of transcriptomic data and external knowledge, which of the following conclusions were supported?
A) Fetal-like transcriptional programs can be reactivated in diseases such as cancer or fibrosis
B) All fetal cell populations contribute directly to adult stem cell pools
C) DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility changes accompany the transition from fetal to adult cellular states
D) Fetal stromal cells support greater tissue plasticity compared to their adult counterparts
Q5: What did single-cell transcriptomic data reveal about metabolic differences between fetal and adult cells?
A) Fetal cells rely more on glycolysis
B) Adult cells predominantly use oxidative phosphorylation
C) Fetal cells have higher mitochondrial gene expression
D) Adult cells have lower metabolic activity overall
