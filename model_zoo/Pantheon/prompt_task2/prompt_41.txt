 Given these single cell RNA-seq data /data/lep/BaisBench/Task2_data/h5ad_file/task2 - Elmentaite et al. (2020) Developmental Cell - Fetal Human Gut.h5ad, /data/lep/BaisBench/Task2_data/h5ad_file/task2 - Elmentaite et al. (2020) Developmental Cell - Paediatric Human Gut.h5ad,  and the background information: In this study, I aimed to map the development of the human intestine, focusing on its early fetal stages, by using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). Understanding human intestinal development is crucial as abnormalities in this process are linked to diseases like Crohn’s disease (CD). My work involved analyzing samples from human embryos (6-10 weeks post-conception) and pediatric patients, including those with CD. The data consisted of 90,000 single-cell transcriptomes from fetal and pediatric gut biopsies, which were processed using the 10X Genomics platform and allowed for the identification of various epithelial and stromal cell types involved in gut formation and disease pathology. , analysis the data to answer the following questions: Q1: Which transcription factor was identified as being upregulated in Crohn's disease epithelium, linked to increased cell proliferation?
A) FOXM1
B) GATA4
C) PAX6
D) SP1
Q2: What key signaling pathway was found to be critical for villus formation and epithelial differentiation during early intestinal development?
A) Notch signaling
B) Wnt signaling
C) Hedgehog signaling
D) TGF-β signaling
Q3: Which of the following cell types was most abundant in the pediatric gut epithelium compared to embryonic and fetal samples?
A) Goblet cells
B) Enterocytes
C) Immune cells
D) Mesodermal cells
Q4: What was observed in Crohn’s disease (CD) patients regarding epithelial cell differentiation?
A) Increased enterocyte differentiation and reduced goblet cells
B) Increased goblet cells and reduced enterocytes
C) Increased Paneth cells and reduced enterocytes
D) Increased tuft cells and reduced goblet cells
Q5: What role did FOXL1+ fibroblasts play in intestinal development, as observed in the data?
A) They were involved in crypt-villus differentiation by expressing BMP ligands.
B) They inhibited the differentiation of intestinal stem cells in the fetal gut.
C) They acted as the major source of WNT3A in the developing intestine.
D) They were the primary source of VEGF for endothelial cell development.
