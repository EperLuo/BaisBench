 Given these single cell RNA-seq data /data/lep/BaisBench/Task2_data/h5ad_file/task2 - Opasawatchai et al. (2022) Front. Dent. Med.h5ad,  and the background information: Dental caries can cause significant changes in dental pulp, affecting immune responses and tissue repair mechanisms. Understanding how different cell types within the pulp respond to caries at a single-cell resolution is crucial for advancing regenerative dentistry. While bulk transcriptomics has provided insights into global gene expression changes, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) allows us to identify cellular heterogeneity and interactions that drive disease progression and tissue response. We used scRNA-seq to characterize cell populations and their molecular responses in sound and carious teeth, highlighting immune cell alterations and cell-cell interactions in deep dental caries.
Sample Source: Dental pulp tissues were isolated from one sound human maxillary third molar and three carious teeth (one with enamel caries, two with deep dental caries).
Cell Isolation & Processing: Enzymatic digestion with collagenase and dispase was used to dissociate the dental pulp tissue into single cells.
Sequencing Platform: Chromium 10X Genomics system (v2 chemistry), sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq system.
Final Dataset: 6,810 high-quality single cells were analyzed. , analysis the data to answer the following questions: Q1: Which immune cell population was uniquely present in deep dental caries but absent in sound and enamel caries samples?
A) Neutrophils
B) CD103+ Dendritic Cells
C) Natural Killer (NK) Cells
D) Basophils
Q2: Which of the following genes was upregulated in deep dental caries and is known to regulate endothelial cell activation and leukocyte adhesion?
A) SFTPB
B) VCAM1
C) COL1A1
D) AMELX
Q3: What ligand-receptor interaction was uniquely enriched in deep dental caries based on the single-cell transcriptomic data?
A) TIMP1-CD63
B) PDGF-B-PDGFRA
C) NOTCH1-JAG1
D) VEGFA-FLT1
Q4: Which of the following best describes the role of macrophages in deep dental caries, as inferred from single-cell transcriptomic data?
A) They secrete amelogenin to regenerate enamel.
B) They express antigen presentation genes such as HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1.
C) They produce odontoblast-like cells for dentin repair.
D) They primarily function as pericytes within the pulp vasculature.
Q5: Which of the following statements about odontoblasts in deep dental caries is supported by single-cell transcriptomic data?
A) They show increased expression of genes involved in odontogenesis, such as ALPL and OMD.
B) They completely lose their ability to produce dentin in deep caries.
C) They downregulate all interactions with immune cells.
D) They exclusively express genes associated with apoptosis.
