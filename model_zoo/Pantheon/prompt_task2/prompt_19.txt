 Given these single cell RNA-seq data /data/lep/BaisBench/Task2_data/h5ad_file/task2 - Martin et al. (2019) Cell.h5ad,  and the background information: In this study, single-cell technologies were applied to examine the immune responses in ileal tissues from patients with Crohn's Disease (CD), particularly focusing on those who have resistance to anti-TNF therapy. CD is an inflammatory bowel disease characterized by chronic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. The authors used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to study cellular heterogeneity in CD lesions. The study included tissue samples from 11 iCD patients with a total of 82,417 lamina propria cells analyzed, which can be used to identify distinct immune and stromal cell types and subtypes that contribute to disease severity and treatment outcomes. , analysis the data to answer the following questions: Q1: What key cellular module was identified in the single-cell transcriptome data that correlates with resistance to anti-TNF therapy in Crohn's Disease patients?
A) GIMATS module
B) TNF-driven module
C) Memory T cell module
D) Inflammatory cytokine module
Q2: Which of the following cell types are included in the GIMATS module identified in the study?
A) IgG plasma cells
B) Inflammatory mononuclear phagocytes
C) Activated B cells
D) Activated T cells
Q3: What was the observed correlation between the presence of the GIMATS module and clinical outcomes in Crohn's Disease patients?
A) Presence of the GIMATS module was associated with early disease onset.
B) The GIMATS module correlated with failure to achieve durable corticosteroid-free remission upon anti-TNF therapy.
C) The GIMATS module was linked to remission regardless of anti-TNF therapy.
D) No correlation was observed between the GIMATS module and treatment outcomes.
Q4: In the data, what interaction was specifically enriched in patients with the GIMATS module?
A) Interactions between T cells and epithelial cells
B) Interactions between macrophages and dendritic cells
C) T cell-IL17 interactions
D) TNF interactions between immune cells
Q5: Which of the following conclusions are derived from both single-cell transcriptome data and external knowledge in the study?
A) GIMATS module's role in resistance to anti-TNF therapy
B) Involvement of monocytes in GIMATS module
C) TNF blockade is sufficient for treating all iCD patients
D) Correlation between GIMATS module and circulating monocytes
