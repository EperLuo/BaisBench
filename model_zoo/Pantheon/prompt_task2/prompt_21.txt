 Given these single cell RNA-seq data /data/lep/BaisBench/Task2_data/h5ad_file/task2 - Moerkens et al. (2024) Cell Reports - media.h5ad, /data/lep/BaisBench/Task2_data/h5ad_file/task2 - Moerkens et al. (2024) Cell Reports - IFN.h5ad,  and the background information: In this study, I aimed to explore the cellular and molecular dynamics of human small intestine development using a human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived small intestine-on-chip model. The goal was to understand self-organization and tissue maturation processes at the cellular level. To analyze gene expression across various stages of development, I performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on the organoid model. The dataset consists of 30,000 cells from several replicates of iPSC-derived small intestine cultures. This resource provides detailed insights into the transcriptional landscape and cell-type diversity within the small intestine model, which is valuable for understanding both healthy tissue development and disease mechanisms. , analysis the data to answer the following questions: Q1: Which of the following cell types was identified in the small intestine-on-chip model through single-cell RNA sequencing?
A) Myocytes
B) Enterocytes
C) Hepatocytes
D) Adipocytes
Q2: Which of the following features were observed in the iPSC-derived small intestine-on-chip model?
A) Cell type-specific gene expression
B) Dynamic transcriptional changes across developmental stages
C) Static gene expression profiles across all cell types
D) Formation of neuronal cell clusters
Q3: Which of the following pathways were enriched in the differentiated small intestine tissue according to the data?
A) Epithelial cell signaling
B) Gut barrier function
C) Neural signaling pathways
D) Fatty acid metabolism
Q4: What type of cells were involved in self-organization within the iPSC-derived small intestine model?
A) Paneth cells
B) Enterocytes
C) Fibroblasts
D) Goblet cells
Q5: What does the gene expression profile of the small intestine-on-chip model suggest about its maturation?
A) It indicates successful differentiation into functional small intestine tissue.
B) It shows no significant differentiation across stages.
C) It confirms the formation of neurons in the model.
D) It highlights only the presence of immune cells in the tissue.
